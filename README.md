# Welcome to my Travel Companion Front End Project!

This is my a project developed utilising TypeScript and Vue, built on and using the backend API I created previously to showcase a responsive, React based news website. Key features include:

- Accessible semantic HTML
- Reactive elements built according to user stories
- Reusable components
- Implemented Vue Router for dynamic URLs
- Loading state and optimistic rendering for enhanced UX
- Both external and internal API's utilised for in-depth information

The back end of the project can be found using the following link: [Travel Companion Backend](https://github.com/xsaynt/be-readysetpack).

The hosted site can be found using the following link: [Hosted Travel Companion Web App](https://readysetpack.netlify.app/)

(Please be patient as there may be a brief loading period for the sight to fully appear and for the trips to render.)

## Requirements for running locally

`Node.js version v22.8.0 or later`

## Setup

To clone the repository, start by clicking "Code" from my [GitHub](https://github.com/xsaynt/fe-readysetpack) and copy the given URL. Then enter the following in your terminal:

`git clone *copied URL*`

`code fe-readysetpack`

This will clone and open the new folder in VS Code.

Once the repo has been cloned and is open in VS Code, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`npm install`
You can then run the local development server with the command:

`npm run dev`
Ctrl + click the localhost link in the terminal to open in your browser.
